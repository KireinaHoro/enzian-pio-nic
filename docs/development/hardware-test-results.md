# Recorded Enzian test results

Historical evidence from zuestoll14, 2026-09-08–10. Use the
[execution guide](hardware-test.md) for a new test. Evidence under `out/` is local
and ignored; recipes and helpers are tracked.

| Build | Timing evidence | Observed result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2812450, `aa32b1af` | Route WNS −1.314 ns | Original 101 add calls passed; two verified-reset repeats each passed 100 calls |
| 2811847, `93f4c1da` | Route WNS −2.073 ns | Static-shell read oops despite successful programming and both ECI links in RUN |
| 2383312, `4fa10def` (Mar 20) | Final WNS −0.164 ns, TNS −165.535 ns, WHS +0.004 ns | Initial shell-read oops; two verified-reset repeats passed module/revision checks but failed RPC |

The older repeats failed differently: first RPC timed out; second client
creation reported unable to receive. No oops occurred in either repeat. All four
repeat trials measured CPU core 0–0.00390625 V and FPGA core 0 V before power-up.
Reset dwell changed before repeating, so reset sensitivity and run-to-run
variation remain confounded. WNS alone does not explain the outcomes; these
small samples establish neither long-term reliability nor timing closure.
The last recorded state was 2812450 serving add at `192.168.129.200`, with
`cpu40g1` down. Recheck reservation and machine state in every new session.

## Evidence locations

- `out/hardware-tests/reproducibility/verified-trials/summary.json`: four trials,
  exact manifest, reset/program/console logs and per-trial gateway client output.
- `out/hardware-tests/reproducibility/repro-{01,02}-{2812450,2383312}/`: copied
  server logs/client CSVs. September CSVs each contain 100 correct results.
- `out/hardware-tests/2812450/`: first successful boot and `rpc/client-{one,100}.csv`.
- `out/hardware-tests/2811847/`: negative/refactored-negative tests, programmed
  `positive-load/console.log`, direct 64-bit read SIGBUS, and `eci-edge.csv`.
- `out/hardware-tests/2383312/`: initial older test and final `timing.rpt`.
- `out/hardware-tests/build-selection/`: successful CI traces and timing comparison.
- `reproducibility/trials/` contains excluded harness failures: monitors were
  read after their deinitialization. `monitor-recovery/` records the correction.

The negative test twice confirmed synchronous external abort `0000000096000210`
in `probe_versions`; disassembly located the static-shell version read at
`0x97effffffff8`. The shell survived and `insmod` received SIGSEGV. Matching
software was always rebuilt at the hardware commit with a flake-only kernel
release fix; the original uncorrected `6.8.12` module was never force-loaded.

## Older artifact discovery

On ba2, `Downloads/artifacts(21).zip` matched job 2383312 by exact CI generation
timestamps; later successful NIC revision checks corroborated the association.
`artifacts(22).zip` matched June 12 job 2645398 (`76c1ae40`) by timestamps, with
route-selection WNS −1.484 ns. June 3 jobs 2623585 and 2622870 had much better
route estimates (−0.089/−0.009 ns), but direct artifact requests returned 404.
March's legacy `add.x` lacks request IDs; its matching client source/binary is
retained in `out/hardware-tests/2383312/client/` and gateway
`/scratch/pengxu/lauberhorn-e2e-2383312-client/`. Do not use the newer wire schema.
